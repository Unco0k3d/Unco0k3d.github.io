               <p> Winston Churchill was born in 1874. Why was he so important? 
                He saved Britain! Winston was a political figure. He became a 
                member of parliament in 1900 and became prime minister of Britain. 
                He was known to give powerful and inspiring speeches. This would prove
                 paramount for what was to come.<br>
                 <br>
                World War II, Winston saw Hitler as a threat before most members of
                 parliament. Hitler waged war on the world, he was successfully
                  swallowing up most of Europe until he reached Britain’s doorstep. 
                  Nazi’s were running many bombing raids on Britain. Parliament was 
                  heading for a truce, but Winston was not one to give in. Nazi’s were
                running many successful bombing missions on Britain and the Royal Air
                Fleet were struggling to defend. When parliament was ready to 
                 make a truce Winston was outraged. He made his case with the most 
                    captivating speech known today.
