      <h3 id="finding-out">Finding out</h3>
      <p>
        March 22nd 2018 my first MRI, little nervous, but not too nervous. While
        in the machine I tried to imagine all funky noises as electronic music
        beats to distract myself from the powerful magnetic waves going through
        my head. Don’t worry, it wasn’t painful and no side effects that I know
        of followed. But, that was about to be the least of my worries. The
        technician running the MRI came in at round two to inject the
        contrast. He injected the contrast and I started to get the symptoms I’ve
        had for three years prior to the MRI. He looked perplexed, he started to
        ask if I felt alright and asking me if I felt dizzy or if I had a
        headache. I responded “no I feel fine” other than the uncontrollable
        muscle movement in my right limbs paired with a tingly-numbness that I
        blamed on stress and anxiety all those three years. At this point I was
        questioning in my head “Why is he asking me these questions?”. He then
        proceeded to ask what I did for a living. I responded that I was a
        graduate looking for an IT job. He added some small talk about how the
        hospital hires a lot.. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something was just not right. The technician told me to wait while he confirms with the doctor that I could leave. My imagination took over. I started to ask myself “Did he see something?”. What if this? What if that?. I didn’t even want to think about it because I started to panic. Then he came back and proceeded to shake my hand and said “good luck on the job hunt, and make sure you call your neurologist in the morning”. I thought to myself maybe he didn’t see anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the next morning I called, set up an appointment for like two days later and that’s when my neurologist broke the news to me. “Sooo, we found something on your MRI.. You have a brain tumor.” I was in shock because I remember thinking to myself “You should be more worried than you feel right now.” She asked if I felt scared, and I responded “yes” because I knew that was the appropriate response. She said good I’d be worried if you weren’t, little did she know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next she asked if there was anyone she should call. I immediately said my Mom. No girlfriend at this time, maybe for the best given my current situation. Anyway, we called her on speaker and told her everything. I could sense she was in shock too. She had so many questions. Driving home I thought  “I have to be strong for my Mom” I met her at the door I couldn’t even speak and just broke down saying “I want to be strong for you”.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the shock faded there were a lot of friends to tell. I was very optimistic at the time. I kept myself thinking it might be benign because that’s what the doctors told me. Within the same day I met with a neurosurgeon. He did the typical neuro-checks on me and asked me what my symptoms were. I told him all the main stuff which included: tingly-numbness in right limbs with an occasional muscle twitch, which I now understand to be tremors. Once he was finished. He seemed hesitant and looked as though he wanted to choose his words carefully, and went on to say something along the lines of “it’s in a difficult spot” and he was going to need someone with “gray hairs” with him if he were to operate on me. He then mentioned I would be awake during the surgery! At this time I felt like I was in survival mode and took everything as it came. The meeting ended with uncertainty and he said he wanted to operate within two weeks. It also ended with a prescription of steroids and an anticonvulsant (Dexamethasone and Keppra).
      </p>
      <p>
        This neurosurgeon ended up deciding to refer me to another neurosurgeon at the University of Rochester where I ultimately had my craniotomy. My surgery ended up being scheduled for May 15th a little over 8 weeks after my diagnosis. I believe their reason for doing this is that they wanted to put me through a research program that would help them with the surgery. It was cutting edge medical science. They put me through a battery of tests using an FMRI (Functional MRI), this type of MRI maps my brain down to the submillimeter level. The way it works is they put you in the FMRI which looks like a normal MRI machine with a computer screen in it. During the test they asked me questions about images, or they would ask me to move the limb where the partial seizures were affecting. When I reacted to the stimuli a certain part of my brain would light up. For example, one of the trials was to see a face and say whether it’s a boy or a girl. That one was rapid fire, you had to respond fast. Another was to see an image and naming what the object is. Those kinds of interactions were to map where my speech paths were. The physical part consisted of giving me ques to move my right wrist/hand or my foot/ankle. That mapped the parts of my brain for movement. It’s part of the neurosurgery process, but it is also research so I was paid for my time there. I made a little over $150 for 8 hours I believe.

        <h3 id="dex">Dexamethasone</h3>
        <p>
            The greatest drug I’ve ever been on if it weren’t for all the negative side effects. They included: weight gain from my body’s increased water retention and hunger. I could not stop eating, for breakfast I would have two eggs and toast, yogurt with fruit, and a thick chocolate chip pancake that I made from scratch using the Alton Brown recipe. I highly recommend that recipe. Thanks Alton! But, before I continue to the positive side effects I want to list all the negatives that I experienced:<br></b> Note: Side effects vary from person to person:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight gain</li>
            <li>Muscle Loss (Atrophy)</li>
            <li>Never satisfied after eating</li>
            <li>Increased appetite</li>
            <li>Taste bud changes (Able to taste either really sweet or really salty, not in between)</li>
            <li>Leg muscle/joints pain when I eat too much sugar.</li>
            <li>Acne (mostly on the shoulders and my back, some on my face)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I want to delve into not being satisfied after eating. I felt as though I had a craving for certain foods, but that craving was never quenched. It felt like I could eat forever and that was frustrating. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What’s interesting is that although there are all these negative side effects, I felt as though I had a clarity that I’ve never experienced in my life. I wasn’t sure if it was false confidence or an overactive mind. I would wake up at 5 am and felt inspired to write. Words would just pour out of my fingers (if that’s even a saying). During this time I made a list of things to do around the house because one of the benefits to Dex is that you feel as though you have an endless energy. Not only that, but waking up wasn’t even a problem. No grogginess and no back pain, which I had pretty severely. I felt as though I accomplished so much in so little time when it came to cleaning or house projects. I felt as though I also had more focus in gaming too. It felt great to be honest. It was like unlocking brain power I’ve never had.

        <h3 id="surgery">Surgery Day</h3>
        <p>
            I wasn’t too nervous. At the time I was just focused on what was in front of me. I went to bed around 11pm, I didn’t fall asleep till about 12am. Woke up around 5am, like usual. Took the trip to the hospital, checked in, was called up, and before I knew it I was in a bed waiting for what was ahead of me. I was wheeled into a room of what looked like over 10 people or more. The team then propped me onto the surgery table and the anesthesiologist said “here is some oxygen” and put a mask over my face and that's the last thing I could remember.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it came time for them to wake me up for the awake session of the surgery I felt as though I woke up at home. I thought the nurse calling my name was my mother hahaha. I then realized I was in surgery and it was time for action. The nurse would occasionally instruct me to move a certain right limb. Then when the doctor was probing my brain a certain limb would jump involuntarily and the nurse would relay which limb moved. I’m not sure if I had a sense of time during all of this. I think I remember me being a little impatient before the end, but not too much. The one thing I do remember was hearing the suction machine and the surgeon say something along the lines of “looks like a rats nest” and him instructing medical students since I was in a learning hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they closed me back up I heard them put the bone back, it kind of sounded like a ceramic lid. They then secured the bone to my skull with circular titanium plates. Upon exiting the surgical room I remember telling the surgical staff to thank my surgeon Dr. Pilcher as I was getting emotional. Soon after that I was wheeled out still awake and apparently that’s a rare thing because the tech in this post surgical area said that that’s the first time she saw somebody coming out awake and I was feeding myself ice! I felt a little special. But, that quickly faded when one of the surgical staff leaned over me telling the nurse or tech or whatever that it was a glioma. In my head I heard glioblastoma, I started to tear up. I didn’t want to cry so only tears ran down my face.

        <h3 id="hospital">Hospital Stay and Coming Home</h3>
        <p>
            After all that I was in recovery on the “neuro floor”. Most of my family came to see me, they stayed a while and chatted with me and amongst each other. That night I couldn’t sleep, not that I wanted to sleep. My eyes were just glued to the TV. Must have been all the drugs I was pumped with. Now, I’m not sure if it’s like this for everybody, but for me all my friends expected me to be fully functional. Right out of the gate everyone wanted to see me  But, I just couldn’t handle that much stimulation. Before I go on, I suggest that you create a facebook group to send out updates to all friends. Then you don’t have to text people one at a time and such. Anyway, I was just about to write an update in the group and found out that I could barely type. I knew what I wanted to type, but my fingers couldn’t do it. This was very scary.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just want to take the time to clearly explain what happened to me physically after surgery. The evening after surgery I felt functional for the most part. It wasn’t till the next day that debilitating things started to happen. After waking up the second day my right side just felt so weak, and as I mentioned previously I could not text or type. It would take me a good 20 minutes to get a few sentences written. I then realized I could barely feed myself, but did succeed. I walked with a limp, and when it came to bathing myself I totally forgot how to, I just had to figure it out. Same with getting dressed, shaving, brushing teeth, etc. Like, I knew what I wanted to do at the pace I used to do it, but my brain lagged. One morning I wanted to make pancakes and it was exhausting. My brain couldn’t decide whether to turn left or right. The most  bizarre thing to mention is that after the surgery I was missing most of the spinal fluid in my brain, which was causing the deficits mentioned before. But, the weirdest part of that is that I could hear a sloshing sound in my head every time I moved it. And, at times, when the pressure built from my body working on restoring the void of spinal fluid. I could hear it moving past the not yet mended skull bone. Sorry if that grossed you out, but it was the strangest part of the healing process.

            When I got back home my sister got me an 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bed-Wedge-Pillow-Adjustable-Heartburn/dp/B07PLMGC9C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VTQT9UW2JFEI&keywords=adjustable+wedge+pillow+for+sleeping&qid=1583340195&sprefix=adjustible+wedge+pillow+for+sleeping%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-1">
                adjustable wedge pillow</a> that I highly recommend using because I had to sleep at an incline to drain my head of fluids. I crashed on that thing till the next morning. When my mother woke me up she was holding a glass of milk for me to drink. Now normally I don’t ever drink plain milk. Usually I drink chocolate milk, but I ended up drinking the entire cup and it tasted so sweet. The following week consisted of lying on the couch watching a lot of Netflix. My Aunt came in from Arizona during that week to help my Mother. It ended up being a pleasant visit. She ended up lifting my Mothers’ spirits along with helping out. After the sad departure of my Aunt my brother came to visit from Texas. It’s always fun having him around. He has the ability to make many people laugh and keeps my mother distracted with his lectures on the border in Texas (he’s a border patrol agent) and kept me laughing with his quirky humor.

        <h3 id="rad">Radiation and Chemo</h3>
        <p>
            The week after July 4th I started radiation. It was fine for the most part. I drove myself there and back. It was only a 15 minute drive for me. The only complaints I have is that damn mask and the fatigue. Chemo was a whole other beast. I had the choice between Temedor and PCV. My oncologist insisted on doing PCV because it was proven to keep the tumor from growing for an average of 10 years, so I went with it. I won’t go into too much detail of the regimen, just that it was two different pills and two 10 minute infusions each cycle. Cycles lasted a little over a month. When I took the first pill I felt the effects like 2 hours later. The feeling I got was a little bit of nausea. About two cycles in I’d get pretty severe heartburn so I had to avoid acidic food, and took an antacid whenever I needed. I went for walks when I could or felt like it. I did not work during this time I may have been able, but only for like 2-3 hours. I was a line cook and anyone who’s worked in a kitchen knows that it’s high stress, so the most I could have done was some dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time I was on keppra for seizures. I, very stupidly, decided to take it every other day because I thought that it would be okay since I only had partial seizures that I could handle. Until one morning I started having a partial that turned into a grand mal. That was the scariest moment of my life, and I was home alone! Usually people can’t remember the moment they started to have a seizure but I did. As always my partials consisted of right side tingly numbness with slight loss of right side coordination, but it turned into my  right limbes jumping then my wrist started to curl up, my vision went black, my head was pulled back, the last thing I remember was a loud crack of my upper back then I was out. Until I woke up hyperventilating I could not control my breath but after a while it subsided.That was the day I will never again forget to take my pill.

                <h3 id="liver">Liver Troubles</h3>
            <p>
                I was on 5 out of 6 cycles of the chemo when my liver enzymes started to elevate to a point where they had to pause the chemo. They said once they go down that I would be able to start back up. They did not, and haven’t over a year now since March 2019. They said they’ve never seen this in the 20 something patients they have treated. They asked several times if I had been drinking alcohol. I always said “noo, I can’t because of the seizure medication” the alcohol reacts with the medication in such a way that it makes me more vulnerable to seizures and like I said before, Never again! So then they referred me to a liver specialist. They threw all the tests they had in their arsenal at me. MRI’s, CAT scan, liver biopsy. Endoscopy. They weren’t 100% but they diagnosed me with PSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis). It’s a progressive disease that scars the liver, so I might have to get a liver transplant in 10 years. Sucks but one day at a time right? I've adapted to living in the present.

        <h3 id="recovery">Recovery</h3>
        <p>
            Once I was done with chemo I got into recovery mode. It might seem odd but I would make pancakes every morning from scratch, <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/instant-pancake-mix-recipe-1938544">Alton Browns recipe</a> very good. I also drank the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNIL49O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Smart Fruit</a> drink. It comes as puree. It's perfect for those who don't want to take the time to make a smoothy or you can add it to your smoothy, I just added water to it. They also have different mixes, but the one above has aloe in it so I assumed it had healing properties. After my big breakfast I would head to the gym where I would do strength training. I also gained most of my previous weight back, and more so amidst the pandemic.
